OOPD Project: Stock Management System

📌 Project Overview

This project is a Stock Management System implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The system allows shop owners to manage their inventory, add new stocks, review existing stocks, and display available items.

🛠️ Features

📋 Add Stock: Enter item details such as name, price, and quantity.

🔍 Review Stock: Search and modify stock details.

📜 View Inventory: Display all available items in a structured format.

🛑 Exit Option: Properly exits the system while displaying the stock summary.

🏗️ OOP Concepts Used

Encapsulation: Data members are private and accessed via public methods.

Abstraction: Only essential functions are exposed.

Inheritance (Optional Extension): Can be extended to include multiple store types.

Polymorphism (Optional Extension): Could be implemented for different stock categories.
